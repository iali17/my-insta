# My-insta
Nothing too crazy. Just a simple go at an instagram like interface that uses plain javascript, typescript and React for the frontend and MongoDB with Relay for the backend.

This was built to learn and practice React with Relay and thought what better than to "recreate" a facebook product with facebook dev tools.

## Notes
- Does not work if you pull right now because I did not commit the server.js file (haven't gotten around to env/secrets)
- Uses express to load the Graphql endpoint on a different domain (Just got it to work this way for now)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
